# Quantum-Inspired Matrix Acceleration with Low-Rank SVD

This repository demonstrates a powerful, classical linear algebra techniqueâ€”low-rank approximation via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)â€”to dramatically accelerate common matrix operations like GEMM (Matrix-Matrix) and GEMV (Matrix-Vector). While a classical method, its principle of focusing on the most significant information to achieve massive efficiency gains mirrors the philosophy behind many quantum algorithms.

The included Jupyter Notebook, `GEMM.ipynb`, provides a complete walkthrough of the concept, its mathematical foundation, performance benchmarks, and a real-world application to optimizing the self-attention mechanism in Transformer models.

## ðŸš€ Key Concepts

In AI, scientific computing, and data science, large matrices are everywhere. Operations on them, especially matrix multiplication, are computationally expensive and can become a significant performance bottleneck.

* **GEMV (Matrix Ã— Vector):** `~O(nÂ²)` operations
* **GEMM (Matrix Ã— Matrix):** `~O(nÂ³)` operations

When a matrix has a low "effective rank" (meaning its essential information is captured by a small number of singular values), we can approximate it as a product of three smaller matrices:

$$ A \approx U_k S_k V_k^T $$

This allows us to replace one large, expensive multiplication with a chain of smaller, faster ones, reducing both **computational time** and **memory storage**.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Benchmarks

The notebook benchmarks this technique against standard NumPy operations, demonstrating significant improvements.

### Time & Space Complexity (A: 1000x1000, k=50)

For a 1000x1000 matrix, a low-rank approximation with `k=50` yields:

* **~5.1x Speedup** for Matrix-Matrix multiplication (GEMM).
* **~3.3x Speedup** for Matrix-Vector multiplication (GEMV).
* **90% Reduction** in memory/storage requirements.


*The bar chart above visualizes the drastic reduction in both computation time and storage when using the low-rank SVD method.*

### Real-World Application: Optimizing Transformer Self-Attention

The most significant bottleneck in Transformer models (like those used in LLMs) is the self-attention mechanism, which has a quadratic complexity of `O(nÂ²)` with respect to the sequence length `n`.

By applying a similar low-rank projection principle (as used in models like the Linformer), we can reduce this complexity to `O(nÂ·k)`.

**Simulation Results (Sequence Length n=4096, Low Rank k=128):**

* **âœ… 9.2x Speedup** in execution time.
* **âœ… 32x Smaller** intermediate attention matrix, leading to a massive reduction in memory usage.
